# Welcome to my blog!

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate our Next.js blog system with MDX and syntax highlighting.

## Features

- Written in TypeScript
- Uses Next.js App Router
- MDX support
- Syntax highlighting with custom background and filename
- Read time calculation
- Tagging system

Here's a sample code block with syntax highlighting and a filename:

```typescript filename="greet.ts"
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```
